## User Experience (UX)

Master Math is a site that exposes users to the existence of a mathematics home tutor in London, UK. The site will be targeted toward parents who wish to employ the services of a home tutor to help improve their child's mathematics. Master Math will be useful to parents because it will outline the tutor's unique method of teaching, show them how to go about employing the tutor's services, and provide information on where to find the best resources for studying.

### User Story - New Customer

A new user will find out about the website, likely via a search engine. They will type in key words such as "maths", "tutor" and "London" and be given this website as one of the results. The user will click on it and see the tutor's face and the tagline. They will become intrigued by the tagline and so they click on the call to action button, taking them to the about page. As they land, they will see the educational quote from the philosopher Confucius, and they gain a sense of the tutor's teaching style. They scroll down and find out about the process the student goes through under the tutor's care. They become convinced of the tutor's ability to teach their child. They want to book a time with this person and secure a tutoring slot. They find the last section of the about page, and realise they live within the tutor's serviceable area. They click on the button at the end of the about page and are taken to the contact page. They begin filling out the form with as much detail as they know and hit send. They are then taken to the success page. The user sees that the message has been sent successfully and that there is a page dedicated to resources. The user clicks on that and scrolls down the page. However, the user is uninterested at this time and so closes the tab and waits for their callback.

### User Story - Returning Customer

A returning user will navigate to my website for the purpose of finding extra resources for their child. They know their child has trouble in remembering definitions in GCSE mathematics and so they will be happy to find that one of my recommended resources is Corbett Maths, a website that provices flashcards as one of their resources. The user will read the tutor's description for Corbett Maths and be glad they found it. They will tap on the image and navigate to Corbett Maths.

## Technology

### Languages

- HTML5 - Latest version of HTML. Allows content to be placed on the website.
- CSS3 - Lastest version of CSS. Allows for custom styling of HTML elements.

## Design

### __Colour Scheme__
The initial color scheme was derived using the tool from the [coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

The initial colours chosen were:
- #E2E2E2 (Platinum) - Used for the background colour for the website
- #5E9FFF (Cornflower blue) - Used as the colour for icons, the site logo and text emphasis.
- #EF6F6C (Light Coral) - Used as the background colour for call-to-action buttons.
- #A6BA78 (Olivine) - Used for the submit button on the contact form
- #565254 (Davy's gray) - Used as the color for partitions

According to accessibility guidelines (for users with colour blindness), the contrast ratio between foreground and background should be at least 7:1 for small text. Because of this, some of the colours needed to be changed.

The revised colour scheme is as follows:

- #E2E2E2 (Platinum) - Used for the background colour for the website
- #0000F4 (Blue) - Used as the colour for icons, the site logo and text emphasis.
- #EF6F6C (Light Coral) - Used as the background colour for call-to-action buttons.
- #A6BA78 (Olivine) - Used for the submit button on the contact form.
- #4A4547 (Davy's gray) - Used as the color for partitions and placeholder text.
- #000000 (Black) - Used for general text.

These are the results of the [contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/):

![Blue on Platinum Background](./assets/media/contrast/contrast-check-blue-platinum.jpg)
![Black on Olivine Background](./assets/media/contrast/contrast-check-black-olivine.jpg)
![Black on Light Coral Background](./assets/media/contrast/contrast-check-black-coral.jpg)
![Davy's Gray on Platinum Background](./assets/media/contrast/contrast-check-gray-platinum.jpg)

### __Typography__

The fonts for this project were:

- Montserrat - Used for headings and button text.
- Noto Serif - Used for paragraph text and other non-header text.

Both fonts were obtained through Google Fonts.

The typography idea was taken from [this website](https://www.fontpairings.com/). I thought both fonts complemented each other well and were appropriate for this project.

### __Accessibility__

In order to adhere to accessibility guidelines for font size, the website is designed so that any font size does not go lower than 16px.

### __Imagery__

Imagery on this website was kept minimal. The only picture on the landing page is a photo of the tutor. The idea is for this to make the image stand out on the home page and be more memorable.

An image was also used for the about section to help users guage whether they lived in an appropriate area for the tutor to travel to.

Screenshots were taken of various websites for the resources section. This gives the user a short break from the monotonous black-on-platinum on the page and also allows for an area the user can click on to navigate to that site.

## Features 

### Existing Features

#### __Header and Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all six pages, the fully responsive header and navigation bar includes links to the Home page, About page, Contact page and Resources page; and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 
  - On smaller screens, the navigation bar will change in layout to present the navigation links below the website logo.

![Nav Bar - Desktop](./assets/media/features/navbar-feature.jpg)
![Nav Bar - Mobile](./assets/media/features/navbar-responsive-feature.jpg)

#### __The Landing Page__

  - The landing page includes three main sections.
  - The first section includes a photo of the tutor along with some basic information which together take up a third of the page's width on desktop, and a large tagline filling the rest of the page's width. Below the tagline, there is a call to action button.
  - Regarding the tagline, the word "better" is highlighted in blue in order to catch the user's attention and invoke a good feeling for the user, since "better" is a positive word.
  - The call to action button is pink which should catch the user's attention next, inviting them to navigate to the about section. 

![Landing Page - Section One - Desktop](./assets/media/features/landing-page-section-one-desktop.jpg)

  - On devices like tablets which have smaller screens, the layout of this first section changes. Instead, the tagline is placed first, due to its importance, and then the tutor and their information is placed below.

![Landing Page - Section One - Tablet](./assets/media/features/landing-page-section-one-tablet.jpg)

  - On even smaller screens like mobile phones, the layout changes further. Below the tagline, the tutor's photo appears first and then the tutor's information.

![Landing Page - Section One - Mobile](./assets/media/features/landing-page-section-one-mobile.png)

  - Below the first section are two more sections which is dedicated to users that are already convinced by the tutor's teaching skills or are returning to the website seeking resources for their children. The layout of these two sections change minimally on smaller screens.

![Landing Page - Section Two and Three - Desktop](./assets/media/features/landing-page-section-two-three-desktop.jpg)
![Landing Page - Section Two and Three - Mobile](./assets/media/features/landing-page-section-two-three-mobile.png)

#### __The About Page__

  - The about page is split into three sections.
  - The first section is a quote about education from the philosopher Confucius. The idea is to set the tone for the page and give the user an idea of the tutor's principles in teaching. For a parent who has yet to work with the tutor, this should provide some value to the user and entice them further into working with the tutor.
  - On smaller screens, the name "Confucius" appears in the middle of the screen for better readability.

![About Page - Section One - Desktop](./assets/media/features/about-page-section-one-desktop.jpg)
![About Page - Section One - Mobile](./assets/media/features/about-page-section-one-mobile.jpg)

  - The next section on the about page provides an outline of the tutor's story and details how the tutor will ensure the best outcome for their students. It can be difficult for a parent to trust someone else to teach their child and so this provides value in setting expectations regarding exactly what services the tutor does and does not provice. Parents who do not like the approach do not move forward, whereas parents who do will scroll further and attempt to book a callback.

![About Page - Section Two - Desktop](./assets/media/features/about-page-section-two-desktop.jpg)

  - The last section allows the user to find out whether they live in an area appropriate for the tutor to travel to. This is a further filter so that the tutor can ensure they can work with the ideal client.
  - At the bottom of this section is a call to action button directing the user to the contact page. This is exactly where the user wants to go once they have been convinced of the tutor's expertise and professionalism.
  - This section is fully responsive but the layout does not change on smaller screens.

![About Page - Section Three - Desktop](./assets/media/features/about-page-section-three-desktop.png)

![About Page - Section Three - Mobile](./assets/media/features/about-page-section-three-mobile.jpg)

#### __The Contact Page__

  - The contact page begins by congratulating the user in finding their way to the contact page while the tutor still has availability. This is to create a sense of scarcity; with the idea being that tomorrow, the tutor's schedule may be all filled out. 
  - The text below the congratulations message also reminds the user what the process is to securing a callback and promts the user to fill out the following form.
  - The form is split into two parts, left and right on desktop. The left hand side contains required fields asking for essential information the tutor needs to call the parent back, while the right side contains an optional textbox for the parent to write a custom message.
  - The form provides value to the parent because by this point they want this tutor to teach their child. Becasue of this, they would want to give as much information as necessary to the tutor so they can do their job to the best of their ability. Filling out the form gives the parent more confidence in the tutor's abilities.

![Contact Page - Desktop](./assets/media/features/contact-page-desktop.jpg)

  - While being responsive, the form also chanages layout on smaller screens. The left side which asks for essential information is placed on top, while the textbox is placed beneath. This is to allow the user to still see the placeholder text on smaller screens so it is clear what they should write there.

![Contact Page - Mobile](./assets/media/features/contact-page-mobile.png)

#### __The Success Page__

  - On submitting the contact form, the user will be directed to a page telling the user that their message has been sent successfully. This provides value to the user becasue a user may become anxious that something has gone awry if they are not provided a confirmation message; it comforts the user.
  - Following the success message, there is a call to action section allowing the user to be shown the way to the resources page. This provides further value to the user because some parents may want some extra work for their children to do while they wait to secure a tutoring session.
  - If the user does not wish to go to the resources section, they are also given the option to navigate to the landing page. This will allow the user to see the website tagline and tutor's basic information, and further reinforce their decision in selected this tutor.

![Success Page - Desktop](./assets/media/features/success-page-desktop.jpg)

#### __The Resources Page__

  - The Resources Page begins with a short introduction telling the user what this page is about.
  - The main section below the welcome message is split into two parts, GCSE and A-Level Maths.
  - Both parts are styled the same with a screenshot on the left hand side and on the right, a brief description of the website's resources and the tutor's recommendation in how to use it.
  - This provides great value to the user becasue there is a great variety in reasons to use each resource which can cater for a variety of needs.

![Resources Page - Desktop](./assets/media/features/resources-section-desktop.png)

  - While being responsive, the resources page also changes layout on smaller screens. The screenshot image of the website is shown below the title of the resource, and the description is shown below. This is done to give better readability to the user.

![Resources Page - Mobile](./assets/media/features/resources-section-mobile.png)

#### __The 404 Page__

  - This page will load for the user in the unlikely event that there are broken links on the website or if a user were to type in a nonexistent subdirectory into the web address box.
  - This provides value to the user by directing them to the landing page of the website so that they can achieve their goal for visiting.

![404 Page](./assets/media/features/404-page-desktop.png)

#### __The Footer__ 

  - The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for MAster Maths. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.
  - The footer also includes an anchor allowing the user to quickly move to the top of the page. This is exceptionally valuable to the user if visiting the Resources or About page which can be quite long on mobile.

![Footer](./assets/media/features/footer-desktop.png)

  - On smaller screens, the space between the items decreases but the layout does not change.

![Footer](./assets/media/features/footer-mobile.png)

### Features Left to Implement

- On extremely small screens, it may be a better design for the website name be changed to a Logo just like the favicon on the left hand side, while the right hand side changes into a hamburger menu. Then the hamburger menu is tapped, the navigation menu is shown.

- An alternative layout for the header on extremely small screens may be for the website name to stay the same while the navigation links are replaced by a circle button; which, when tapped, will reveal a navigation menu which pushes the rest of the pages content down with a smooth scroll.
