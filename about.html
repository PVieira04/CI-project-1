        <h1>The Process</h1>
        <p class="about-text">During my decade of experience in education, I have found the most effecive ways of teaching Maths.</p><br>
        <p>Having interviewed tutors and helped them improve their practice, I know how every tutor starts out... and I was no different.</p><br>
        <p>Every tutor begins teaching Maths the same way. They would ask: "What are you doing in Maths lessons at the moment, and where do you need to feel you need to improve?"</p><br>
        <p>This is a fine start, however many tutors stop there and every session is either doing homework together or the tutor watches as the student goes through questions that the tutor sets them.</p><br>
        <p>This is the <span>most ineffective</span> use of a tutor's time. </p>
