            <h2 class="heading">The Process</h2>
            <p>
                Having interviewed dozens of tutors and helped them improve their practice, 
                I know how every tutor starts out... and I was no different.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Every tutor begins teaching Maths the same way. They would ask 
                their students: "What are you doing in Maths lessons at the moment, 
                and where do you need to feel you need to improve?"
            </p><br>
            <p>
                This is a fine start, however many tutors stop there and every 
                session involves either doing homework together or the tutor watches 
                as the student goes through questions that the tutor sets them.
            </p><br>
            <p>This is the <span>most ineffective</span> use of a tutor's time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The purpose of a tutor is to help a student through their areas of 
                difficulty. My approach ensures this happens in the most efficient 
                and optimal way.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                When you employ my services, this is the process:
            </p><br>
            <ol>
                <li>You fill out the contact form.</li>
                <li>I will receive your message and begin preparing documentation for the callback.</li>
                <li>I will call you back on the number provided.</li>
                <li>You and I will discuss your child's needs and when the best time is to book an assessment session.</li>
                <li>During the assessment session, I will discover your child's strengths as well their areas of improvement.</li>
                <li>I will then set some work for them to complete in their own time.</li>
                <li>During the next session, I will review the homework with your child.</li>
                <li>During the review, my approach will be to coach them into thinking about what they could have done in order to solve the problems they came across.</li>
                <li>Following the coaching segment, I will go through the mathematics of the problems they could not solve by themselves.</li>
                <li>At the end of the second session, I will set work again to be completed for next session.</li>
                <li>This lesson structure continues for subsequent sessions.</li>
            </ol><br>
            <p>
                The idea behind this strategy, which has already worked wonders with many of my 
                students, is to invoke a sense of responsibility for the student's own learning. Yes, I as the 
                tutor am there to help your child solve their problems... but if I directly solve all of their 
                problems for long enough, I will become their crutch. They will always be looking 
                to someone else to solve their problems for them.
            </p><br>
            <p class="tutor-quote">
                My job as a tutor is to teach my students <span>so that they no longer need me</span>.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Not many people are willing to put themselves out of a job, but that is my
                dedication to education.
