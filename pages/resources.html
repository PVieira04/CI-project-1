        <h2>Corbett Maths</h2>
        <div>
            <div class="screenshot">
                <a href="https://corbettmaths.com/" target="_blank"><img src="../assets/media/corbett-maths-screenshot.jpg" alt=""></a>
            </div>
            <p>
                Corbett Maths is a great resource for GCSE. Specifically the "Videos and Worksheets" section is fantastic for working on a specific area. Each area has its own video and set of questions to work though. Additionally, Corbett Maths have their own Revision Flashcards that have worked wonders for my students in the past.

            </div>
            <p>
                BBC Bitesize is a great website if you want a comprehensive list of topics for the whole GCSE organised by exam board. My recommendation to use this tool is as a "beginning of session" revision tool. Use their test feature first to check your knowledge and then revise the parts you got wrong.

        <h2>Maths Made Easy</h2>
        <div>
            <div class="screenshot">
                <a href="https://mmerevise.co.uk/gcse-maths-revision/" target="_blank"><img src="../assets/media/maths-made-easy-screenshot.jpg" alt=""></a>
            </div>
            <p>
                Maths Made Easy is a fantastic resource to use when exam prepping, for both GCSE and A Level. The best feature of this website is its plethora of past exam papers to practise from, as well as their predicted papers. The predicted papers are invaulable as a resource as they are full of questions nobody has seen before.

        <h2>White Group Maths</h2>
        <div>
            <div class="screenshot">
                <a href="http://whitegroupmaths.com" target="_blank"><img src="../assets/media/white-group-maths-screenshot.jpg" alt=""></a>
            </div>
            <p>White Group Maths is a fantatic resource for A Level because of their extensive question and solution bank. While mostly geared to the US syllabus, the topics are clearly laid out and so can be easily found.</p>
        </div><br>
        <h2>A Level Maths</h2>
        <div>
            <div class="screenshot">
                <a href="http://alevelmaths.co.uk" target="_blank"><img src="../assets/media/alevel-maths-screenshot.jpg" alt=""></a>
            </div>
            <p>A Level Maths organises their teaching in the form of blog posts. First, use the search function to find the topic you want to revise. Once you reach your desired topic, the summary section makes it easy to digest the main points and the detailed explanation has many examples to explain their points.</p>
        </div><br>
        <h2>Physics and Maths Tutor</h2>
        <div>
            <div class="screenshot">
                <a href="http://physicsandmathstutor.com" target="_blank"><img src="../assets/media/physics-maths-tutor-screenshot.jpg" alt=""></a>
            </div>
            <p>Physics and Maths tutor is my number one go-to resource when it comes to practising Maths A Level topics. If you need endless pages of past exam questions dedicated to one topic, then look no further. Use this resource before you begin revising using past exam papers.</p>
